Notes:

- I completed this homework ahead of time on 2/9.
- Did not get more time to finish all the optionals as I'm on my honeymoon. Submitting this for now, may update later.
- Had trouble configuring the color for the page scroller.
- still confused on the scrolling piece, when to add the arrows and what to set the size of the view, scrollview, images.
